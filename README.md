# Given:

An integer number n
Your task is to:

# Write a function that returns an array with the numbers from 1 to n with the following restrictions:
for multiples of 3 store "Fizz" instead of the number
for multiples of 5 store "Buzz" instead of the number
for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 store "FizzBuzz"

Example:
```
fizzbuzz(15) == {
    "1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz",
    "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz",
    "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"
}
```
